# ðŸ”¨ Make Action

Runs "make" against a given target/Makefile, either locally or from a
downloaded/remote repository. Can optionally pass flags to the make command.

## make-action

## Usage Example

The simplest example runs make against the local directory. Without passing
any arguments, the "Makefile" must be in the current working directory:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run make'
    uses: lfreleng-actions/make-action@main
```

The next example pulls down a repository containing a Makefile to a local
folder, then runs make inside that project directory:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run make'
    uses: lfreleng-actions/make-action@main
    with:
      repository: 'some-owner/some-project'
      path: 'some-project'
      make_args: '-C some-project'
```

The example below checks out the remote repository at the current directory:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: 'Run make'
    uses: lfreleng-actions/make-action@main
    with:
      repository: 'some-owner/some-project'
```

Note: this replaces any previous content in the current working directory

## Notes

This action checks for the presence of the "make" binary on the runner, but
will NOT install it if the required binary isn't found/located in the PATH.

Will automatically populate make_args with `"-C {{ inputs.path }}"` when
repository provided and path specified, but make_args is empty.
