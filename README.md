## Notes

This action checks for the presence of the "make" binary on the runner, but
will NOT install it if the required binary isn't found/located in the PATH.

When provided with a remote repository, the action will automatically change
into the relevant folder once it has downloaded; you do not need to specify
the downloaded repository/folder separately. Use the "makefile_path" input to
specify where the target "Makefile" is relative to the repository root
folder/location.
